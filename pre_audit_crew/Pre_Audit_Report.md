### Comprehensive Report on Basel Pillar II for Banks (2025)

#### Executive Summary
This report provides a detailed analysis of Basel Pillar II for Banks, focusing on the sub-processes, risks, controls, and testing procedures. The report is structured into four main sections: Executive Summary, Detailed Findings, Compiled PRCT Matrix, and Complete Source References. The findings are based on the provided context, which includes global and UAE-specific regulations, standards documentation, and risk assessments.

#### Detailed Findings

1. **Pillar 2 Supervisory Review Process (SRP)**
   - **Process**: Ensures banks maintain adequate capital to support all risks and develop better risk management techniques.
   - **Risk**: Inadequate capital buffers leading to financial instability.
   - **Risk Rating**: High
   - **Control**: Regular stress testing and scenario analysis.
   - **Test**: Conduct periodic stress tests and compare results against regulatory thresholds.

2. **Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)**
   - **Process**: Requires banks to assess their capital needs based on their risk profile.
   - **Risk**: Underestimation of risk exposure leading to insufficient capital reserves.
   - **Risk Rating**: Medium
   - **Control**: Implement robust risk assessment models and regularly update risk parameters.
   - **Test**: Validate risk models through back-testing and sensitivity analysis.

3. **Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)**
   - **Process**: Conducted by regulators to evaluate banks' risk management practices and capital adequacy.
   - **Risk**: Weak governance and risk management practices leading to regulatory non-compliance.
   - **Risk Rating**: High
   - **Control**: Establish a strong governance framework and enhance risk management capabilities.
   - **Test**: Conduct internal audits and regulatory compliance checks.

4. **Pillar 2 Capital Requirement**
   - **Process**: A bank-specific capital requirement that supplements the minimum capital requirement (Pillar 1).
   - **Risk**: Insufficient capital to cover bank-specific risks leading to solvency issues.
   - **Risk Rating**: High
   - **Control**: Maintain a capital buffer above the regulatory minimum.
   - **Test**: Perform capital adequacy ratio (CAR) calculations and compare against benchmarks.

5. **Pillar 2 Disclosure Requirements**
   - **Process**: Requires banks to disclose information on their risk management practices and capital adequacy.
   - **Risk**: Inaccurate or incomplete disclosures leading to reputational damage.
   - **Risk Rating**: Medium
   - **Control**: Implement robust disclosure policies and ensure accurate reporting.
   - **Test**: Conduct periodic reviews of disclosure documents to ensure accuracy.
