### Basel Pillar II for Banks Sub-Processes Documentation (2025)

#### 1. **Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)**
   - **Process**: The SREP is a key sub-process under Basel Pillar II, where supervisory authorities assess and measure the risks that banks are exposed to. This process involves evaluating the bank's internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and determining the bank-specific Pillar 2 capital requirement (P2R).
   - **Stakeholders**: 
     - **Regulatory Authorities**: European Central Bank (ECB), national regulators.
     - **Banks**: Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG (pbb) and other financial institutions.
     - **Investors**: Equity and debt investors.
   - **Process Relationships**: The SREP is closely linked to the Pillar 1 minimum regulatory capital requirement and the capital conservation buffer. It also interacts with the countercyclical capital buffer and systemic risk buffer.

   **PRCT Matrix**:
   - **A- Process**: Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).
   - **B- Risk**: Inadequate capital to cover potential losses from adverse scenarios.
   - **C- Risk Rating**: High.
   - **D- Control**: Implementation of a robust ICAAP and adherence to the P2R set by regulators.
   - **E- Test**: 
     1. Review the bank's ICAAP documentation.
     2. Verify the calculation of the P2R.
     3. Assess the bank's compliance with the capital conservation buffer and other buffers.
     4. Conduct stress testing to ensure capital adequacy under adverse scenarios.

#### 2. **Pillar 2 Capital Requirement (P2R)**
   - **Process**: The P2R is a bank-specific capital requirement that supplements the Pillar 1 minimum regulatory capital requirement. It is determined by the supervisory authorities based on the bank's risk profile and internal capital adequacy assessment.
   - **Stakeholders**: 
     - **Regulatory Authorities**: ECB, national regulators.
     - **Banks**: Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG (pbb) and other financial institutions.
     - **Investors**: Equity and debt investors.
   - **Process Relationships**: The P2R is directly related to the SREP and the Pillar 1 requirements. It also interacts with the capital conservation buffer and other regulatory buffers.

   **PRCT Matrix**:
   - **A- Process**: Pillar 2 Capital Requirement (P2R).
   - **B- Risk**: Insufficient capital to cover bank-specific risks.
   - **C- Risk Rating**: High.
   - **D- Control**: Regular review and adjustment of the P2R by supervisory authorities.
   - **E- Test**: 
     1. Verify the calculation of the P2R.
     2. Assess the bank's compliance with the P2R.
     3. Conduct stress testing to ensure capital adequacy under adverse scenarios.

#### 3. **Capital Conservation Buffer**
   - **Process**: The capital conservation buffer is an additional layer of capital that banks are required to hold above the minimum regulatory capital requirements. It is designed to ensure that banks have a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial stress.
   - **Stakeholders**: 
     - **Regulatory Authorities**: ECB, national regulators.
     - **Banks**: Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG (pbb) and other financial institutions.
     - **Investors**: Equity and debt investors.
   - **Process Relationships**: The capital conservation buffer is closely linked to the Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 requirements. It also interacts with the countercyclical capital buffer and systemic risk buffer.

   **PRCT Matrix**:
   - **A- Process**: Capital Conservation Buffer.
   - **B- Risk**: Insufficient capital buffer to absorb losses during financial stress.
   - **C- Risk Rating**: Medium.
   - **D- Control**: Regular monitoring and adjustment of the capital conservation buffer.
   - **E- Test**: 
     1. Verify the calculation of the capital conservation buffer.
     2. Assess the bank's compliance with the buffer requirements.
     3. Conduct stress testing to ensure the buffer is sufficient under adverse scenarios.

#### 4. **Countercyclical Capital Buffer**
   - **Process**: The countercyclical capital buffer is a macroprudential tool that requires banks to hold additional capital during periods of excessive credit growth to mitigate the risk of a financial downturn.
   - **Stakeholders**: 
     - **Regulatory Authorities**: ECB, national regulators.
     - **Banks**: Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG (pbb) and other financial institutions.
     - **Investors**: Equity and debt investors.
   - **Process Relationships**: The countercyclical capital buffer interacts with the Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 requirements, as well as the capital conservation buffer.

   **PRCT Matrix**:
   - **A- Process**: Countercyclical Capital Buffer.
   - **B- Risk**: Insufficient capital buffer to mitigate the risk of a financial downturn.
   - **C- Risk Rating**: Medium.
   - **D- Control**: Regular monitoring and adjustment of the countercyclical capital buffer.
   - **E- Test**: 
     1. Verify the calculation of the countercyclical capital buffer.
     2. Assess the bank's compliance with the buffer requirements.
     3. Conduct stress testing to ensure the buffer is sufficient under adverse scenarios.

#### 5. **Systemic Risk Buffer**
   - **Process**: The systemic risk buffer is an additional capital requirement imposed on systemically important banks to mitigate the risk they pose to the financial system.
   - **Stakeholders**: 
     - **Regulatory Authorities**: ECB, national regulators.
     - **Banks**: Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG (pbb) and other financial institutions.
     - **Investors**: Equity and debt investors.
   - **Process Relationships**: The systemic risk buffer interacts with the Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 requirements, as well as the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer.

   **PRCT Matrix**:
   - **A- Process**: Systemic Risk Buffer.
   - **B- Risk**: Insufficient capital buffer to mitigate systemic risk.
   - **C- Risk Rating**: High.
   - **D- Control**: Regular monitoring and adjustment of the systemic risk buffer.
   - **E- Test**: 
     1. Verify the calculation of the systemic risk buffer.
     2. Assess the bank's compliance with the buffer requirements.
     3. Conduct stress testing to ensure the buffer is sufficient under adverse scenarios.
