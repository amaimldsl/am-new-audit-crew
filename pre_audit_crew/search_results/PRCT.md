### Summary of Risk Prioritization:

1.  **High-Risk Processes**:
    -   Pillar 2 Supervisory Review Process (SRP)
    -   Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)
    -   Pillar 2 Capital Requirement
    -   Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment (Liquidity Risk, Credit
        Risk)
2.  **Medium-Risk Processes**:
    -   Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment (Underestimation of Risk
        Exposure, Operational Risk, Market Risk)
    -   Pillar 2 Disclosure Requirements (Inaccurate Disclosures,
        Reputational Risk)

This comprehensive PRCT matrix compilation ensures that all processes
are categorized, risks are prioritized, and control measures and test
steps are documented in detail. \`\`\`
